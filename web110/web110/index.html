       <p>Hello, my name is Neale and I'm currently in my first quarter of the Web Design certificate program at Seattle Central. 
       <br>I love the outdoors and the mountains. I hike, backpack, and camp regularly in the summer. I also really enjoy travelling. Most recently I went on a trip to Sydney, Australia for my birthday last November. It was the most amazing and adventurous thing I've ever done! I got the opportunity to do so many incredible things including climbing the Sydney Harbor Bridge at sunset.
       </p>

       <h3>Why Web Design?</h3>

       <p>I have been in retail management and healthcare administration for over a decade and it just hasn't allowed me to do much creatively. It also hasn't allowed me to travel as much as I'd like to.
       <br>After Australia I decided to change that. I'm hoping to build a career in web design that will allow me to be both creative and technical with the opportunity to work remotely from time to time, or for clients throughout the U.S. and around the world.
       </p>
